# Language-Learning
### Bienvenue, peeps.
Welcome to my personal language learning experiment. Because if at first you don’t succeed, try, try, and then document everything on GitHub for the world to see.

Having spent a ridiculously long time pretending to learn languages, I decided to create this space to track my sporadic progress, organize my already-growing collection of resources, and document the existential insights that come with learning French (or at least attempting to).

Currently, I’m attempting French. Despite spending five years in my adolescence studying the language, much of what I "learned" has vanished into the ether. I realize I fell victim to the illusion of competence; mistaking the ability to recognize a word for actually knowing it (spoiler: I didn’t). This time, I’m committed to breaking the cycle and going full language immersion, active recall, and meaningful practice...no more "French" in my head that's just loose pronunciation.


### Basics of My Learning Strategy
My approach is simple (but not too simple, we’re stepping it up):

**Active Recall** : I’m going to constantly quiz myself on vocabulary, grammar, and key phrases, because just passively reviewing words is the ultimate trap (trust me, I’ve been there, and I’ll never get those 5 years back).

**Language Immersion**: I’m absorbing French. Podcasts, painfully awkward conversations with strangers, 60s lover music, you name it. If French doesn’t start living in my brain, I’ll force it in there.

_Quick special thanks to my sweet, incredible, darling friends, whose support and inspiration unknowingly motivated me to embark on this journey._
